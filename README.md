## Description
#### Motivation:
The motivation behind building the Note Taker application was to streamline the process of note-taking and organization for users.

#### Why Build:
The Note Taker application is a web-based tool that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to manage their notes and stay organized. Users can access the application through a web browser and interact with it in real-time. 

#### Problem Solved:
Instead of using traditional pen and paper or multiple note-taking apps, users can access all their notes in one place and easily manage them.

#### What Was Learned:
In this project, I gained practical knowledge in backend web development using Node.js and Express.js. I implemented CRUD operations, JSON parsing, and handled HTTP requests. As part of the project, I also worked with Inquirer.js for command-line interface input. Overall, it provided me with a valuable hands-on learning experience in building functional and interactive applications.
